Python-Project-Euler
==================================

This is my first attemp at a python project, barring some basic NLP forays in college.

Furthermore, this is my first attemp at using GitHub to publish and colaborate on code.

My goal is to work out solution to the problems at Project Euler (projecteuler.net).



Interactive Euler Shell
==================================

With python installed, the interactive shell can be accessed by running the command 'python eulerShell.py' from the project directory.

The shell dynamically loads the newest versions of the solutions, and provides commands to display the problem description, solve the problem, or time the solution.

All problem solutions can be run as individual scripts by executing the command 'python solutions/euler#.py', where # is number of the implemented solution.
